#Text Bookmarks
Don't bookmark just links - bookmark a chosen text on the page and/or share it with everyone.

#How it works
1. You select a text on the page.
2. Right click on it.
3. Choose either "Bookmark <selected-text-here>" or "Copy link to <selected-text-here>".
* If you've bookmarked the text, it'll appear in a separate "Text Bookmarks" sub menu in the context menu (when you right-click on the page and nothing is selected). From there, you can click on any of your text bookmarks, and the bookmarked page will open with the bookmarked text pre-selected.
* If you've copied a link to the text, you can paste it into your browser's address bar (or share it with a friend, who uses this addon), and the bookmarked page will open with the bookmarked text pre-selected.

#Manage Text Bookmarks
From the context menu, when you right-click on an empty space with no text selected, you can choose "Manage Text Bookmarks...".
A dialog will open.

From this dialog you can manage your text bookmarks.
You can delete them, export them, or import previously exported text bookmarks, either by you, or one which a friend have send you.

Enjoy!
